LogParser Plugin

This plugin will parse the console output and show the information needed by the parse rule provided by user.
We will need this plugin for parsing and diffing the console output.

How does this plugin work?

LogParserParser: the parser object

	HashMap statusCount: count the lines of each type in the console output, specified by LogParserConsts
	LogParserConsts: the object that contains 6 types of information: ERROR, WARNING, INFO, NONE, START, DEFAULT
	parseLog(): create the parsed log file (log.html) by calling parseLogBody()
	parseLogBody(): open the console outupt file and parse it line by line (BufferedReader)

LogParserPublisher: member function perform()
perform(): 1. create parser with rules
           2. parse the log
           3. mark build as faild or unstable if necessary by checking the log file made in step 2
           4. add an action created with above results

What we can do to modify this plugin for our purposes?

Purpose: diff the console outputs
How: The logparse plugin has generated the parsed output and gather the output information by types
	 Therefore, we now have the parsed output. We have two choices:
	 	1. each time we parse, we save the parsed output as JSON object for comparison; or
	 	2. each time we parse, we save the parsed output as plain text for comparison.
	 For diff, we will need to check the differences for each type of information.
